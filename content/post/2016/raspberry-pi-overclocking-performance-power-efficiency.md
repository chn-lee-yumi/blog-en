## Preparation

- Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.
- A power meter bought on Taobao for 37 RMB.
- Power supply from my Nubia Z9 Max, 5V 1.5A.

## Testing Method

- Modify `config.txt` to overclock via `arm_freq`.
- Change `scaling_governor` from `powersave` to `performance` to ensure the CPU runs at maximum frequency.
- Use `aircrack-ng -S` to measure power consumption and performance under full load.

## Data Table

| Frequency (MHz) | Idle Power (W) | Full Load Power (W) | Performance (k/s) | Performance/Freq | Performance/Power |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|600|1.75|2.31|339|0.56500|146.75|
|700|1.82|2.65|397|0.56714|149.81|
|800|1.83|2.81|455|0.56875|161.92|
|900|1.84|2.94|514|0.57111|174.83|
|1000|1.83|3.08|571|0.57100|185.39|
|1050|1.84|3.13|600|0.57143|191.69|
|1100|1.89|3.37|629|0.57182|186.65|

Note: At 1100MHz, the system could not run stably under full load at default voltage. After testing, setting `over_voltage=2` made it stable.

## Conclusion

- With `governor` set to `powersave`, idle power consumption is 1.75W.
- With `governor` set to `performance`, idle power consumption remains almost unchanged across frequencies, around 1.84W.
- Performance per frequency slightly improves as frequency increases.
- With `over_voltage=0`, performance per watt improves as frequency increases.

**Therefore, to improve performance per watt, we can overclock as much as possible without increasing voltage, provided the system remains stable.**

Moreover, even with overvolting at 1100MHz, its performance per watt is still better than 1000MHz at default voltage. Methods to improve low-frequency performance per watt are discussed in the postscript.

## Postscript

These are experiments I did after completing the experiments above.

### Unexpected Findings

- After overclocking, even when the CPU frequency stays at 600MHz, there is a slight increase in power consumption and performance under full load.
- At maximum frequency 1000MHz but actual frequency 600MHz, full load power is 2.33W, performance is 341k/s. Idle power remains unchanged (original idle power 2.31W, performance 339k/s).

**This indicates that overclocking slightly increases full-load power consumption and performance even at the lowest frequency (600MHz).**

### Stability Testing with Overvolting

```
arm_freq=1050
over_voltage=3
```

- No difference in idle power consumption with `powersave` governor.
- With `performance` governor, idle power is 1.91W, full load power is 3.38W, performance is 599k/s.
- At the same frequency, overvolting increases power consumption, does not improve performance, causes more heat, and reduces performance per watt.

**Thus, if the system is stable, overvolting is not recommended.**

### Methods to Improve Performance per Watt

An unexpected discovery: I set `over_voltage` to a negative value, hoping to undervolt. I thought it wouldn't boot, but surprisingly it worked! This means we can improve performance per watt by lowering the voltage.

```
arm_freq=800
over_voltage=-3
```

With `performance` governor, idle power is 1.78W, full load power is 2.63W, performance is 456k/s, performance per watt = 173.38 (original idle power 1.83W, full load power 2.81W, performance 455k/s).

This suggests that as long as the system remains stable, we can lower the voltage to improve performance per watt. (In fact, my laptop i7-4710MQ CPU has been undervolted by 0.1V for a long time.)

**Therefore, if you find your Raspberry Piâ€™s performance sufficient (i.e., you've reached your target frequency), you can reduce the voltage as much as possible while keeping the system stable to improve performance per watt.**
