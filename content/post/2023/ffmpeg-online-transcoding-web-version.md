## Introduction

After many years, I have updated the web version of FFmpeg again. It is developed based on [ffmpeg.wasm](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm).

It basically runs FFmpeg inside the browser. Of course, the performance is much lower, so it is only suitable for temporary use or converting small files and transcoding.
