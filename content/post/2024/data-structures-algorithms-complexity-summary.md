- The **logn** space complexity of quicksort comes from the recursion stack.
- Whether quicksort is stable or in-place depends on the partition function. Common implementations are in-place but unstable.
- Building a heap has a time complexity of **n**.
- For Tree Sort, building the tree takes **nlogn**, and traversal takes **n**. If the tree becomes highly unbalanced, it degenerates into a linked list, resulting in **n^2** time complexity.

# Data Structures

Time complexity of operations for common data structures.

## Heap

- Insert element: logn  
- Remove top element: logn  

Note: The main logic of insertion and removal is heapify. The time complexity is proportional to the tree height, hence **logn**. Building a heap is **n**, not **nlogn**.

## Binary Search Tree (BST)

- Fast lookup: logn, worst case n  
- Insert: logn, worst case n  
- Delete: logn, worst case n  
- Traversal: n  

Note: BST degenerates to a linked list in the worst case, hence **n**; when balanced, it's **logn**.

## Quickselect

Uses the core idea of quicksort to find the k-th element (k-th smallest or largest) in Î˜(**n**) time complexity.
